# Tensorflow.js Regression
An online canvas where we can interactively work with different types of Regression and two different types of Optimizer is along with it. <br>
Types of regression: <br>
1. Linear Regression

2. Binomial Regression
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_regression
3. Trinomial Regression
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression

Optimizer types:
1. Stochaistic Gradient Decent (SGD)

2. ADAM Optimizer
